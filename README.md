# NLP_PROJECT

This project aims to analyze sentiment in Indian languages using a combination of machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP). This project presents a deep learning approach to sentiment analysis in Indian languages. The project utilizes three different neural network architectures, namely CNN, LSTM, and GRU, to build sentiment analysis models. Additionally, transfer learning is employed using FastText, MURIL, and IndicBERT embeddings. The models are trained and evaluated on a translated dataset derived from the Sentiment140 dataset from Kaggle. Performance measurements, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are used to assess the effectiveness of the models. The project aims to address the challenges of sentiment analysis in Indian languages by leveraging advanced deep learning techniques and linguistic diversity, providing valuable insights into sentiment analysis across different languages and cultures.
